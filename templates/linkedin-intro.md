Hello Michael! My name is Ilsa Hampton I am an entry-level software engineer interested in potentially applying for a role with Citrix. I was hoping to gain some insights on the application process and available roles to be on the look out for. 

Thanks for your time and any advice!
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly! I think my biggest questions are: 1) what do you feel was the biggest challenge in the interview process for you? 2) How do feel about your transition into your workplace with Citrix? (ie is it a steep learning curve, feels welcoming etc) and lastly 3) what excites you the most about working for Citrix?
